# I Notebook 

This project is a web application that combines both the backend API and the frontend components. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing and organizing your notes, along with user authentication for secure access.

## Backend API

The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides a RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes. Additionally, it includes user authentication endpoints for user registration and login. The backend uses `MongoDB` as the database to store user information and notes.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using React.js. It offers a modern and responsive user interface that allows users to interact with their notes. The frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch and update data in real-time. It also includes user login and registration forms for secure access to the application.

## Features

- Create new notes with a title and content.
- View and edit existing notes.
- Delete notes that are no longer needed.
- User registration and login for secure access.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in both the backend and frontend directories.
3. Start the backend server by running `npm start` in the backend directory.
4. Start the frontend development server by running `npm start` in the frontend directory.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

Please note that you will need to set up a MongoDB database and configure the backend API accordingly for user authentication to work properly.
